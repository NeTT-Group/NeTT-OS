# NeTT OS

The new repository for NeTT OS. After 5 years of NeTT OS (then called TouchOS) being a shell for MS-DOS with simple and limited commands and functions, NeTT OS will now be a full GUI based on Linux. NeTT OS will be unique in the way that the entire UI is completely different to most operating systems. NeTT OS is also optimised for touch-based systems while being equally easy to use on a traditional desktop.

## Release date

NeTT OS 6 has been cancelled, with NeTT OS 7 being released some time in 2029.

Linux kernel guide
==================

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
